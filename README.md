## 📱 Responsiveness

The app is mobile-friendly:
- Grid layout adjusts automatically:
  ```css
grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3
```
- Cards shrink and stack on smaller screens.

---

## 📝 Code Quality

- Clear variable names  
- Reusable components (`BookCard`, `SearchBar`)  
- Comments added for readability  
- Tailwind CSS for clean, modern styling

---

## 🧪 Testing

Test the following scenarios:

1. Normal search with results  
2. Search with no results → displays “No books found”  
3. Simulated network failure → displays error message  
4. Mobile and desktop views → check responsiveness  

---

## ✨ Optional Improvements

- Pagination for large result sets  
- Detailed book page on card click  
- Favorites or bookmarking system
